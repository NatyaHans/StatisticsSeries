It is also called Validity.\nPrecision: Consistency of measurements. It is also called Reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample - statistics\nPopulation - parameters\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\\(\\bar{x}\\)\n\\(\\mu\\)\n\n\nStandard Deviation\ns\nùùà\n\n\nVariance\ns2\nùùà2\n\n\nSize\nn\nN\n\n\n\nNote: Random Sampling is difficult in biology/real world due to following reasons:\n\nSampling units do not represent natural distinct habitats\nCannot be numbered in advance\nPopulation covers a large area\nHence haphazard sampling method are used which ar assumed to be same as random sampling\n\nRandom Sample ( More technical definition )\n\nSimple Random Sampling\nIf a sample size n is drawn from a population of size N in such a way that every possible sample of size n has the same chance of being selected, the sample of size n has the same chance of being selected, the sample is called a random sample.\n\nwith replacement: every individual member of population is available at each draw\nwithout replacement: one less( or more) individual after each draw\n\nSystematic Random Sampling:\neg. health records, stored in a systematic way. Total number of records needed to be studied are calculated. A random number table is then employed to select the starting point in a file system.\neg. if we have x as the starting point then x+k , x+2k, x+3k can be different record sets where k is an interval used to define the sampling interval. It is not useful for study where you observe a gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nData point\n\n\n\n\n1\n24\n\n\n2\n34\n\n\n3\n36\n\n\n4\n34\n\n\n5\n27\n\n\n6\n91\n\n\n7\n16\n\n\n8\n17\n\n\n9\n29\n\n\n10\n20\n\n\n11\n21\n\n\n12\n32\n\n\n\nStratified Random Sampling: When sample units are grouped i.e.¬†the population is partitioned into strata ( which are more similar in nature than other strata), much less variability is observed\n\nStratified systematic sampling\nStratified sampling proportional to size of population in each strata"

Sampling error just refers to the fact that statistics derived from a sample are only estimates of true parameters of the whole population and it has got nothing to do with error during calculation.\nSampling error of mean is the difference between sample mean and population mean.\nMeasurement Scales:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal\nOrdinal\nInterval\nRatio\n\n\n\n\nnaming and classifying into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories\nranked according to some criteria. usually impossible to infer different members of two adjacent categories and compare it with other adjacent\norder measurements based on distance between them.\nThis is the only truly quantitative scale\nEquality of ratios and equality of intervals may be determined\n\n\neg: male-female;\nwell-sick;\nunder 65- over 65\neg: socio-economic status - low,medium,high\neg: 10 to 20 has 10 as interval and so does 30 to 40.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Study: A research study is a scientific study of phenomenon of interest. Research studies involve designing sampling protocols, collecting and analyzing data, and providing valid conclusions based on results of analyses.\nExperiment: Special type of research study in which observations are made after specific manipulations of conditions have been carried out; they provide the foundation for scientific research.\nOrdered array: from smallest to largest values\nRule of thumb for determining class intervals: No less than 5 and no more than 15 class interval.\nwidth of class intervals = \\(w=\\frac{R}{K}\\) ; where \\(R\\) = range i.e.¬†difference between largest and smallest number an \\(k\\) = number of class intervals.\nk is determind by sturges‚Äôs rule\n\\(k=1+1.322(log_{10}n)\\)\nHere,\n\\(n\\)= number of values in the data\n\\(k\\)= number of class intervals\nNote: Relative frequency ~ experimental probability ~ empirical probability"
